# Seedweb Base

A FastAPI application for managing multiple seed germination beds. The
beds have a Raspberry Pi Pico controlling LEDs, and taking sensor readings
for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The Picos post data to the API
and query the API for a status which returns a response sayin whether or
not the lights should be on and what color pattern (Profile) to use.

This project is very much a work in progress. Come back in a bit
for more comprehensive documentation.
